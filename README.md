# Quantum Gallery
By Graham Zemel

This is a fun gallery project I made since I recently have taken up photography. 

Here's the camera I use for these pictures: [Canon EOS Rebel T4i](https://amzn.to/4eXVrRJ)

If I'm being completely honest, I don't know all the specs of the photos I take but I try to include the information that I can in the captions of each picture.
